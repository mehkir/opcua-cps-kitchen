# OPC UA CPS-Kitchen

## Intro
Cyberphysical systems in dynamic environments require adaptability to react appropriately.
The OPC UA standard facilitates service accessibility and monitoring of cyberphysical devices of the industrial domain. This implementation integrates a cyberphysical kitchen into a OPC UA structure using the open62541 library.

## Kitchen Environment
The kitchen environment consists of several robots positioned along a circular conveyor belt that moves in one direction.
The cyberphysical kitchen employs a multiagent system to process placed orders.
In total, there are four agents: Kitchen, Robot, Conveyor and Controller.
- The Kitchen-Agent assigns placed orders to Robot-Agents and monitors the connectivity of all other agents - the Robot, Conveyor and Controller.
- Robot-Agents prepare the dishes assigned to them according to the FIFO principle. Each of them uses a certain set of tools to accomplish partial steps of an order. In other words, their capabilities differ from each other which requires them to cooperate to complete dishes.
- The Conveyor-Agent retrieves completed and partially finished dishes from the Robot-Agents and coordinates the assignment of partially finished dishes or delivers completed dishes to the Kitchen-Agent.
- The Controller-Agent monitors the operation status of Robot-Agents to choose a suitable robot for the next steps of a dish, when the Kitchen- or Conveyor-Agent asks for it.

## Kitchen Workflow
The sequence diagram below shows the workflow of the kitchen.
First, the Kitchen-Agent asks the Controller-Agent for a suitable Robot-Agent to prepare a dish according to the placed order.
After the Controller-Agent responds with a suitable Robot-Agent, the Kitchen-Agent assigns the Robot-Agent to process the order.
The Robot-Agent prepares the dish to the best of its capabilities and notifies the Conveyor-Agent about it whereupon the Conveyor-Agent retrieves it.
The Conveyor-Agent checks then if the dish is done completely or partially.
If partially, the Conveyor-Agent asks the Controller-Agent for a suitable Robot-Agent for the next preparation steps and delivers it there.
Otherwise the Conveyor-Agent delivers a completed dish to the Kitchen-Agent.

## Robot Capabilities and Tools
Each Robot-Agent has a certain set of capabilities to perform preparation steps of incoming orders.
They are defined in a JSON array like below and are tied to corresponding tools.
Robot-Agents must therefore retool if the currently equipped tool cannot perform a required preparation step.
```json
{
    "capabilities" : ["boil","braise","fry"]
}
```

## Recipes
The kitchen describes orders via recipes.
Recipes are described in JSON format like below.
A recipe is identified by an ID and consists of the attributes *name*, which specifies the name of the dish, and an *instructions* array, which contains the preparation steps arranged in sequential order.
Each step is described by an *action* that specifies the preparation step, the *ingredients* that specify the required ingredients, and a *duration* that specifies the time the *action* takes to finish.
An *action* without a *duration* takes the time a Robot-Agent needs to perform it.

```json
"1" : {
    "name" : "pumpkin soup",
    "instructions" : [
        {
            "action" : "...",
            "ingredients" : "..."
        },
        {
            "action" : "cut",
            "ingredients" : "onion"
        },
        {
            "action" : "braise",
            "ingredients" : "pumpkin, carrot, ginger, onion"
        },
        {
            "action" : "boil",
            "ingredients" : "pumpkin, carrot, ginger",
            "duration" : 10
        },
        {
            "action" : "...",
            "ingredients" : "..."
        },
    ]
}
```

## Dashboard
The dashboard shows the processing status of orders and operation status of all agents.
It is divided into three areas:
- The top provides the two input fields *SETUP DASHBOARD* and *PLACE RANDOM ORDER/S*.
The former field expects the count of Robot-Agents to setup the dashboard accordingly.
The latter expects to put in any positive number to place random orders.
- The middle shows the processing status of orders, the Controller-Agent's connectivity and how many Robot-Agents registered with it, and the Conveyor-Agent's connectivity with its total capacity as well as how many plates are currently free or occupied.
- The bottom shows the operation and utilization of the Robot-Agents and the Conveyor-Agent in detail.

## Relevant Directories
This repository contains directories and files which were helpful to familiarize oneself with the open62541 library.
The following directories can be ignored and are not relevant to the functionality of this project: demos (except the discovery_server.cpp), statistics, tests and timestamp.

## Compilation
There are the following build scripts in the project root directory:
- [build.bash](build.bash) produces a Release build of the OPC UA Kitchen project.
- [build_debug.bash](build_debug.bash) produces a Debug build of the OPC UA Kitchen project.
- [build_for_sanitizer.bash](build_for_sanitizer.bash) produces a Debug build of the OPC UA Kitchen project with ThreadSanitizer (TSan) enabled and no optimizations (-O0) for clearer diagnostics. Replace -DUSE_TSAN=ON with -DUSE_ASAN=ON for AddressSanitizer (ASan).
- [build_doc.bash](build_doc.bash) generates the projectâ€™s documentation.

Compile the project with the [build.bash](build.bash) script in the project root directory.
Optionally compile the code documentation with the [build_doc.bash](build_doc.bash) script in the project root directory.

## Starting the Environment and Dashboard
If you have not yet cloned the project, proceed as follows:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mehkir/opcua-cps-kitchen
```
If you already cloned the project without the `--recurse-submodules` parameter, run the following command in the project directory:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
The kitchen environment is started with the [startup_kitchen.bash](start_scripts/startup_kitchen.bash) script and expects the robot count as a parameter.
For example, when you are in the project root directory:
```bash
start_scripts/startup_kitchen.bash 4
```
The dashboard is started with the [start_dashboard.bash](start_scripts/start_dashboard.bash) script and expects the robot count as a parameter as well.
For example, when you are in the project root directory:
```bash
start_scripts/start_dashboard.bash 4
```
*Note: The backend and frontend for the dashboard use the ports 8080 and 8000. Either make sure they are not already in use or change them in [backend.js](cps-kitchen-dashboard/backend.js), [frontend.js](cps-kitchen-dashboard/frontend.js) and [start_dashboard.bash](start_scripts/start_dashboard.bash)*

Open the dashboard in an Internet browser with the address *localhost:8000*.
In the input field *SETUP DASHBOARD* type the robot count you used in the steps before and press enter.
Then type any positive number in the input field *PLACE RANDOM ORDER/S* and press enter.
The Robot-Agents and Conveyor-Agent should now prepare and transport orders.

## Define and Set Capabilities
Capability profiles are set in separate JSON files in the capabilites folder.
Valid actions with their duration are defined in the [robot_actions.cpp](actions/src/robot_actions.cpp) file.
Further actions with durations can be defined there and must be add in the *action_map_* in the constructor.
There are the two types *autonomous_action* and *recipe_timed_action*.
The latter has no duration but must be defined in the recipe.
Further tools can be defined in [robot_tool.hpp](robot/include/robot_tool.hpp) in the *robot_tool* enum class and need a string representation in the *robot_tool_to_string* method to be displayed correctly in the dashboard.
A tool is then tied to an action in the [robot_actions.cpp](actions/src/robot_actions.cpp) constructor.
A capability profile for a Robot-Agent at a certain position can be set in the *position_capabilities* map in [start_robots.bash](start_scripts/start_robots.bash).

## Define Recipes
Recipes are defined in the [recipes.json](recipes.json) file in the root folder.
Recipe IDs must be consecutive starting at 1 with no gaps (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5 is valid; 1,2,4,5 is invalid because 3 is missing).
Only recipe timed actions must define a duration; other actions do not (see also [Define and Set Capabilities](#define-and-set-capabilities)).

## Setting Time Units
The actions and retooling of Robot-Agents and movement of the Conveyor-Agent are simulated with time.
This is modeled with the number of time units each agent needs for a certain action, retooling or movement and the time unit itself.
The time unit is set by the *TIME_UNIT* define in [time_unit.hpp](time_unit.hpp).
For the number of time units consider the following files:
- Robot Actions: You can define and set the time unit count for every action in [robot_actions.cpp](actions/src/robot_actions.cpp).
- Robot Retooling: The time unit count for retooling can be set via the *RETOOLING_TIME* define in [robot_actions.hpp](actions/src/robot_actions.hpp).
- Conveyor Movement: The time unit count for the conveyor movement can be set via the *MOVE_TIME* define in [conveyor.cpp](conveyor/src/conveyor.cpp). In addtion, the *DEBOUNCE_TIME* define sets the time unit count before the conveyor starts to move, after the first notification from a Robot-Agent is received.

## Implement Your Own Scheduling Algorithm
The Controller-Agent responds to "next robot" requests with a suitable robot for the next preparation steps of a recipe.
It chooses the next Robot-Agent in the *find_suitable_robot* method, as shown in the following code snippet:
- Lines 5-8 filter out the already processed steps of the recipe.
- Lines 11-18 iterate through the *position_remote_robot_map_*, which stores all Robot-Agents known to the controller, and select the first agent found that is capable of performing the next preparation step.

```cpp
1:  remote_robot*
2:  controller::find_suitable_robot(recipe_id_t _recipe_id, UA_UInt32 _processed_steps) {
3:      // UA_LOG_INFO(UA_Log_Stdout, UA_LOGCATEGORY_USERLAND, "%s called", __FUNCTION__);
4:      remove_marked_robots();
5:      std::queue<robot_action> recipe_action_queue = recipe_parser_.get_recipe(_recipe_id).get_action_queue();
6:      for (size_t i = 0; i < _processed_steps; i++) {
7:          recipe_action_queue.pop();
8:      }
9:      remote_robot* suitable_robot = NULL;
10:     std::string next_action = recipe_action_queue.front().get_name();
11:     for (auto position_remote_robot = position_remote_robot_map_.begin();
12:         position_remote_robot != position_remote_robot_map_.end(); position_remote_robot++) {
13:         remote_robot* robot = position_remote_robot->second.get();
14:         if (robot->is_capable_to(next_action)) {
15:             suitable_robot = robot;
16:             break;
17:         }
18:     }
19:     return suitable_robot;
20: }
```
More sophisticated scheduling algorithms can be implemented by considering the load/utilization of Robot-Agents and their last equipped tool, which is equipped after the preparation of previously assigned tasks.
For this purpose call the following methods on *remote_robot*:
- *get_last_equipped_tool()* returns the last equipped tool.
- *get_overall_time()* returns the load/utilization.
